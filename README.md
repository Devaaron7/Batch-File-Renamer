# Batch File-Renamer


Hello,

This is a quick script that will rename a batch of files into a uniform ascending naming pattern ( starting from 1 )

1. Select the file(s) you want to copy & rename
2. Select the destination folder
3. Enter a title to be used for the files - output will be "name_1", name_2, name_3, etc

Thank you for checking it out
